Sunshine Android Application

This is my first Android Application built after learning how to build Android
Applications through a Google-sponsored Udacity course. Best practices are used to build this application.

The application is a multi-feature weather app which stores information via a SQLite database and interacts with the OpenWeatherAPI.
